Three things I learned: 
I learned that you can put javascript strings into the chrome console. 
I learned that a program is just a set of instuctions to tell the computer what to do. 
I learned that Aaron likes Nutella. 

My three questions: 
Is it practical to primarily work with one programing language? 
What are the similarities and differences between different interpreters? 
Can an interpreter improve performance?
