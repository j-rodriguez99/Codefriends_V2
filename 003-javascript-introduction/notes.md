Don't go chasing waterfalls! 

Three things I learned: 
I learned that you can put javascript strings into the chrome console. 
I learned that a program is just a set of instuctions to tell the computer what to do. 
I learned that Aaron likes Nutella. 

My three questions: 
Is it practical to primarily work with one programing language? 
What are the similarities and differences between different interpreters? 
Can an interpreter improve performance? 

Primitives:
I learned that the + operator will try and coerce into strings. 
I learned about infinity and -infinity. 
I learned that the ! operator will coerce into booleans. 

Questions about primitives document: 
Is there a practical use for infinity in a program? 
Should we avoid type coercion by having more precise code? 
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck would?
